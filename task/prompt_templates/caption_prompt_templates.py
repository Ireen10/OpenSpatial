Prompt modules for 3D scene caption generation.

Each module category contains multiple phrasings. During prompt assembly,
one phrasing is randomly sampled per category, with per-category dropout
for diversity.

Module categories:
    role       — analyst persona
    task       — task description (100-200 word spatial caption)
    subject    — object analysis focus
    technical  — photographic / composition analysis
    text       — text transcription instructions
    constraint — objectivity constraints
    style      — output formatting style
